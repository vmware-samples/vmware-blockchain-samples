Yet, there are several critical gaps Ethereum platforms have that make them difficult to use for enterprise use cases, such as lack of robust privacy and scalability for complex workloads, governance mechanisms, and enterprise-class operational support characteristics. To address these gaps, VMware launched VMware Blockchain for Ethereum, available now in beta. VMware Blockchain for Ethereum is built using open enterprise-centric architecture. The solution is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible decentralized and permissioned infrastructure platform that provides trust, predictable costs, and instant transaction finality while being Byzantine Fault Tolerant.</p><p>VMware Blockchain for Ethereum comprises blockchain nodes running the open-source EVM evmone 0.8.2, orchestration utilities, Solidity 0.8.16, and third-party integrations. As a result, developers can build on any public or private cloud to deploy their dApps and smart contracts leveraging standard tools such as Truffle, HardHat, and integrations with MetaMask.</p><h2 id="why-use-vmware-blockchain-for-ethereum" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#why-use-vmware-blockchain-for-ethereum" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Why Use VMware Blockchain for Ethereum?</h2><p>The VMware Blockchain technology is built using an open enterprise-centric architecture with an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). As a result, it is a compatible decentralized and permissioned infrastructure platform that provides trust, predictable costs, and instant transaction finality while being Byzantine Fault Tolerant.</p><p>VMware Blockchain for Ethereum comprises blockchain nodes running the open-source EVM evmone 0.8.2 version, orchestration utilities, Solidity 0.8.16 version, and third-party integrations. As a result, developers can construct or extend a platform on any public or private cloud to deploy their dApps and smart contracts leveraging standard tools such as Truffle, HardHat, and integrations with MetaMask Institutional.</p><h2 id="architecture" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#architecture" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Architecture</h2><p>VMware Blockchain is an enterprise-grade decentralized trust platform that enables you to transact and share data securely. With VMware Blockchain, you can create permissioned decentralized business networks. In addition, the decentralized trust platform removes the need to rely on a central data repository that is a single point of failure.</p><p>VMware Blockchain comprises one or more Client Nodes and a Replica Network. The Client nodes provide dApps access to the blockchain data by exposing an ETH JSON RPC interface for sending and receiving requests to and from the Replica Network. The Replica Network is a network of n replicas, where n=3f+1, that participate in the BFT consensus protocol. Each Replica node has an EVM execution engine, which stores the state in an authenticated key-value ledger.</p><p><img src="'+d+'" alt="VMware Blockchain for Ethereum Request Flow"></p><p>Refer to the numbers in the diagram and read the corresponding description to learn about each step that describes the VMware Blockchain for Ethereum request flow.</p><ol><li><p>The dApp creates and signs a request using a local or an external wallet and awaits a response. The request can vary from loading a new smart contract, listing the existing active smart contracts, or activating a function within a current smart contract. For example, a request can either start a smart contract function that fetches a balance that does not alter the state or activate a smart contract function that transfers funds from one party to another, which changes the state.</p></li><li><p>The request is created and sent as an ETH JSON RPC request.</p></li><li><p>The Client Service component in the VMware Blockchain Client node receives the request and sends it to the Replica Network. This component controls the consensus and ensures at least 2f+1 replies are received from the Replica Network before responding.</p></li><li><p>The Replica Network receives the requests processed using a BFT consensus algorithm.</p></li><li><p>The EVM execution engine executes these requests on every Replica node. Some requests write new values to the state, which changes the state. The state is captured in an authenticated key-value store on each Replica node in a RocksDB (5.1).</p></li><li><p>After the request execution is completed, 2f+1 signed execution results are returned to the Client node.</p></li><li><p>The Client node validates that the 2f+1 results have been received and then sends them to the application.</p></li></ol><h2 id="ethereum-concepts" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#ethereum-concepts" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Ethereum Concepts</h2><p>VMware Blockchain is an enterprise-grade private blockchain based on Ethereum. Therefore, certain VMware Blockchain features must be aligned with the Ethereum ecosystem.</p><h4 id="free-gas-mode" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#free-gas-mode" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Free-Gas Mode</h4><p>In a public Ethereum network, gas refers to the cost necessary to perform a transaction on the network. Miners set the gas price based on supply and demand for the network&#39;s computational power to process smart contracts and other transactions. Requiring a fee for every transaction executed on the network provides a layer of security to the Ethereum network, making it too expensive for malicious users to spam the network. VMware Blockchain is a private, permissioned, and managed network. Therefore, it is not required to charge for computation power or protect it from malicious use. In addition, the SBFT protocol protects it from byzantine attacks. Since gas fees are not required, VMware Blockchain by default has free-gas mode enabled.</p><h4 id="privacy" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#privacy" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Privacy</h4><p>In many use cases, businesses and users end-need to be able to conduct transactions securely and privately, without revealing their personal information or the details of their transactions to others. To strike a balance between privacy and performance, VMware Blockchain carefully designed and implemented its privacy solution. Now, any ERC20 smart contract can be extended to convert the public tokens to private tokens. These private tokens can be transacted privately, subject to a limit set by the administrator. Not even the administrator, can see the details of the private transaction, including the source, target or the amount transacted. The platform uses Zero Knowledge Proofs to guarantee that the transaction is valid and ensures that there is no double spending. The privacy solution is currently in Tech Preview - the APIs may change in the future.</p><h4 id="supported-ethereum-json-rpc-api-endpoints" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#supported-ethereum-json-rpc-api-endpoints" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Supported Ethereum JSON RPC API Endpoints</h4>',20),m={href:"https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/apis/json-rpc",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"},f=e("h2",{id:"beta-registration",tabindex:"-1"},[e("a",{class:"header-anchor",href:"#beta-registration","aria-hidden":"true"},"#"),t(" Beta Registration")],-1),b=e("p",null,"VMware Blockchain for Ethereum is currently in the Beta development stage.
