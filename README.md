# VMware Blockchain Samples

Here you will find DApp and Smart Contract samples of how to deploy and interact with VMware blockchain or other Ethereum compatible blockchains.

### Table of Contents

1. [Asset Transfer Contract](./asset-transfer)

   - This is our most simple example of how to compile and deploy one contract.

2. [Supply Chain DApp](./supply-chain)

   - This is a complete example of how to deploy multiple contracts using the popular contract framework truffle.

   - With this sample DApp you can learn contract versioning, access control and document storage all with a complete (UI) interface.

   - There is a [HANDSON](./suppl-chain/HANDSON.md) document that will walk you through the use cases.

3. [Verify and Upload Contracts](./supply-chain/verify)

   - The contract verify example is similar to how users post their contracts on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/verifyContract), but posting to VMware blockchain instead and being able to view the verified contracts in our UI.
