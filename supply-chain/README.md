# Supply Chain Decentralized Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vmware-samples/vmware-blockchain-samples.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vmware-samples/vmware-blockchain-samples)

Blockchain is a platform that contains blocks of data about transactions between parties. The data structure within blockchain links these blocks of data to create a ledger of all the transactions. The data is cryptographically authenticated to prevent alteration and spread of any corrupt entry. <BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>Blockchain has several participant nodes that have full or partial copies of the blockchain. The participant nodes act as validators and consumers of the blockchain. A consensus algorithm allows all the participating nodes in the blockchain to agree on what data needs to be added to the ledger and verified as accurate.

![Supply Chain Use Case](./static/supply-chain.png "Supply Chain Use Case")

One use case of blockchain is to track different types of transactions in a supply chain in a secure and transparent manner. Starting from the manufacturer to the sale of the product every transaction in the supply chain is documented to reduce costs and minimize human error. The supply chain decentralized application (dApp) uses smart contracts, which are self-executing contractual promises, stored on the blockchain that no one controls, and everyone can trust. The supply chain dApp can be used on VMware Blockchain or other Ethereum-based blockchain.

## Quick Setup with Docker

### Prerequisites

Install docker [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Setup

First lets clone the repo and build the container.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:vmware-samples/vmware-blockchain-samples.git

cd vmware-blockchain-samples

docker-compose build
```

Update the `truffle-config.js` with the correct url with the basic auth username and password.

```shell
  vmware: {
    network_id: "*",
    provider: () => new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
      "https://<username>:<password>@<url>"
    )
  },
```

Deploy contracts by running truffle migrate by using our container.

```
docker-compose run supply-chain truffle migrate --network=vmware  
```
![Migrate Contracts](./static/contract-migrations.png "Migrate Contracts")

Update the environment BC_URL endpoint in the `docker-compose.yml` file to point at your ETH RPC instance.

```shell
    volumes:
      - ./contracts:/app/contracts
      - ./migrations:/app/migrations
      - ./build:/app/build
      - ./truffle-config.js:/app/truffle-config.js
    environment:
      # Example
      # - BC_URL=http://localhost/blockchains/local/api/concord/eth
      - BC_URL=<change-me>

```


Then start the server.

```shell
docker-compose up
```
![Docker Up](./static/docker-compose-up.png "Docker Up")

Finally, open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) in your browser.

NOTE: You may need to open an ssh tunnel if you are running on a separate VM

```ssh
ssh -g -L 4200:localhost:4200 -f -N <VM_IP>
```

## Configure and Deploy Without Docker

### Prerequisites

- Verify that you have Git, Node 8.9+ and npm installed.
- Verify that you have installed and configured Truffle v4 suite framework for smart contracts in your environment. See the Truffle [suite installation](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/overview).
```
npm install -g truffle@4.1.15
```
- Verify that the Ganache application, an Ethereum network simulator is running properly. See [Ganache installation](https://truffleframework.com/ganache).


### Setup

Install application dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

Deploy contracts on ganache

```shell
truffle migrate --reset --network=development 
```

Deploy contracts on VMware Blockchain

First go to `truffle-config.js` and update the username, password and path under the vmwware network:

```shell
    vmware: {
      network_id: "*",
      provider: () => new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
        "http://<username>:<password>@vmware.blockchain/blockchains/change/api/concord/eth/"
      )
    },
```
Then deploy the contracts

```shell
truffle migrate --reset --network=vmware 
```

Run tests to verify everything is working correctly

```shell
# On ganache
npm run truffle:test:ganache

# On vmware blockchain
npm run truffle:test:vmware
```

Now lets interact with the contracts, by using the truffle console.

```shell
truffle console
```

In the console
```shell

# Get the deployed contract
let contract;
Orders.deployed().then(function(c){ contract = c});

# Create an order
contract.create(web3.fromAscii("Apples"), 100);

# Get the order address you just created
contract.orders.call(0)
'0xf0de5c223985434b12b8c858ccfa9b9a309a0251'

# Initialize the order into our ABI
# Application Binary Interface (ABI) is a list of the contract's functions and arguments in the JSON format. To use a smart contract's function the ABI is used to hash the function definition so it can create the EVM bytecode required to call the function.
let order = Order.at('0xf0de5c223985434b12b8c858ccfa9b9a309a0251');

# Assign owners
order.setOwners.sendTransaction('0xfa1a4c33aa682d34eda15bf772f672edddac13aa', '0xfa1a4c33aa682d34eda15bf772f672edddac13aa', '0xfa1a4c33aa682d34eda15bf772f672edddac13aa', '0xfa1a4c33aa682d34eda15bf772f672edddac13aa', '0xfa1a4c33aa682d34eda15bf772f672edddac13aa');
'0x221030d0af4734a7e8c8dade5cdd945e9940efa35725daaee3315ff908dd108b'

# Approve the order
order.approve.sendTransaction();
'0xdef210546df026c422f7e1c01785abbf147ec2ae95a7d2a96bf8b8e6edfa345e'

# Get metadata
order.meta.call();
[ '0x4170706c65730000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  BigNumber { s: 1, e: 2, c: [ 100 ] },
  false ]

# Make the metadata more readable
 web3.toAscii('0x4170706c65730000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000');
'Apples\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000'

# Additional metadata improvements
web3.toUtf8('0x4170706c65730000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000');
'Apples'

```
