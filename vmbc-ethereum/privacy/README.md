# Introduction
The privacy of digital asset custody is a critical requirement for enterprises as they consider moving to blockchains. This gets exacerbated with Central Bank Digital Currencies where governments want to balance accountability with privacy in order to prevent money laundering or tax fraud.
VMBC now provides a solution to this problem. Any ERC20 smart contract can be extended to convert the public tokens to private tokens. These private tokens can be transacted privately, subject to a limit set by the administrator. None, not even the administrator, can see the details of the private transaction, including the source, target or the amount transacted.
The platform uses Zero Knowledge Proofs to guarantee that the transaction is valid and ensures that there is no double spending.
The privacy solution is currently in Tech Preview - the APIs may change in the future.

# Architecture
## Kubernetes deployment overview
![Privacy Depiction](./assets/images/PrivacyAppK8s.svg)

The sample application consists of the following components:
 
- Sample Privacy Wallet Application
Each user in the system must own a Privacy Wallet to manage their secrets. In order to send private transactions securely, the wallet needs to have an extra secret (besides the Ethereum private key). The wallet communicates with the Privacy Client Library to generate private transaction payloads. It sends transactions to the EthRpc client over JSON RPC.
 
- Admin Application
The privacy contract administrator deploys the Public Token and the Private Token contracts. It uses the Privacy Client Library to generate the inputs to the Private Token constructor, and calls both constructors. It sends transactions to the EthRpc client over JSON RPC. The Admin Application is also used to set the limits (or budgets) on the amount of tokens that can be transacted privately per user.
 
- Smart Contracts
As part of the "deploy" command, the admin application deploys two smart contracts - Public Token and Private Token. The Public Token is a standard ERC20 token, with three required modifications. The address of the Private Token is a parameter of the constructor. In addition, it has two additional functions - convertPublicToPrivate and convertPrivateToPublic. The former converts the specified number of ERC20 Public Token to Private Tokens (which can now be transacted privately). The latter converts Private Tokens back to a Public Tokens.
The Private Token provides interfaces to Mint and Burn private tokens, and to Transfer tokens privately to another user. It calls cryptographic functions implemented in the platform via EVM pre-compiled contracts.

## How to deploy privacy application
Deployment leverages the helm charts provided with the development kit for privacy application.
### Prerequisite
Deploy kubernetes based leveraging [helm charts](../vmbc-deployment/vmbc-four-node-one-client-deployment/README.md).

### Limitations
- The privacy capabilities are not currently supported with permission enabled blockchain. VMBC must be deployed with read and write permissions disabled before trying out privacy.

- This release supports the following sample application wallets:
  - single administrator wallet and CLI console application.
  - supports pre-configured set of three user wallets and corresponding CLI console application.
```sh
user-1 user-2 user-3
```

- The sample privacy wallets are ***NOT persistent*** hence not crash resilient. In event of restarts users should redeploy another instance of privacy application and configure restarted wallet application to leverage the new instance.
- Operations with any other user name will lead to indertministic results.

### Determine the required settings for helm chart installation

Helm chart for privacy application deployment is available [HERE](List of available configurations in [values.yaml](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vmware-blockchain-samples/blob/stage-dev-kit/vmbc-ethereum/privacy/sample-dapps/private-token-transfer/helm/).) 

List of available configurations and default values available in [values.yaml](https://github.com/vmware-samples/vmware-blockchain-samples/blob/stage-dev-kit/vmbc-ethereum/privacy/sample-dapps/private-token-transfer/helm/values.yaml).

#### Container resource settings
There are default settings tuned for current consumption. You can scale up values if required.

Resource names (Refer to values.yaml): 
```sh
walletapp, walletcli, admin, admincli.
```
Users can optionally override default APP resource settings. The parameter units are based on [kubernetes semantics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

| cpuLimit | max cpu limit | 800m |
| cpuRequest | requested cpu | 700m |
| memoryLimit | max memory limit | 500Mi |
| memoryRequest | requested memory | 400Mi |

Eg.,
```sh
 --set resources.walletapp.cpuLimit=900m --set resources.walletapp.memoryLimit=550Mi
 ```

#### helm chart installation
```sh
helm install --set global.imageCredentials.registry=<registry address> --set global.imageCredentials.username=<username> --set global.imageCredentials.password=<password> --set blockchainUrl=<blockchain Eth RPC URL> <name of privacy app deployment> .

## Privacy application demonstration
The following operations are demonstrated by the privacy application:

Client Administrator application:
- Deploys the privacy application
- Creates privacy budgets for users

Client Wallet application:
- Configures and registers the user wallet.
- Converts public funds to private funds for anonymous transfer.
- Performs private anonymous transaction to another registered user.
- Performs public transaction to another registered user.
- Converts private funds to public funds.

The demonstration client wallet applications have canned private keys and initial public balances. 

### Administrator workflow
Administrator application CLI samples to deploy the privacy application and create privacy budgets for all users:

```sh
kubectl attach vmbc-deployment-privacy-admin-7fd48bdc8f-zhcwz -c privacy-admin-cli -i -t

If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
You must first deploy the privacy application. Use the 'deploy' command.
Enter command (type 'h' for commands 'Ctr-D' to quit):
 > h
Commands:
deploy -- generates a privacy config and deploys the privacy and token contracts.
create-budget <user-id> <amount> -- requests creation of a privacy budget for a user.

> deploy
Deploying a new privacy application...

Successfully deployed privacy application
---------------------------------------------------
Privacy contract: 0x44f95010BA6441E9C50c4f790542A44A2CDC1281
Token contract: 0x3d8b57c2D58BB8c8E36626B05fF03381734EAD43

You are now ready to configure wallets.

 > create-budget user-1 1000
Budget request for user: user-1 value: 1000 was sent to the privacy app
response: ok

 > create-budget user-2 1000
Budget request for user: user-2 value: 1000 was sent to the privacy app
response: ok

 > create-budget user-3 1000
Budget request for user: user-3 value: 1000 was sent to the privacy app
response: ok
```

### Wallet application CLI workflow samples:
- Wallet converts privacy funds from public funds. These private tokens are then leveraged for anonymous transfers.
- Transfers private funds anonymously between users
- Transfers public funds between users
- Converts privacy funds back to public funds

#### User-1 <==> User-2 Samples:
The samples demonstrates transfers and other works flow between user-1/user-2 wallets. Attaching to wallet CLI, configuring and registering are similar for all users.

- Attaches to wallet user-1 CLI
```sh
 kubectl attach vmbc-deployment-privacy-wallet-0 -c privacy-wallet-cli -i -t
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

You must first configure the wallet. Use the 'config' command.

Enter command (type 'h' for commands 'Ctr-D' to quit):
 > h
Commands:
config                    -- configures wallets with the privacy application.
show                      -- prints information about the user managed by this wallet.
register <user-id>        -- requests user registration required for spending coins.
convertPublicToPrivate <amount>             -- converts the specified amount of public funds to private funds.
transfer <amount> <to-user-id> -- transfers the specified amount between users.
public-transfer <amount> <to-user-id> -- transfers the specified amount of public funds between users.
convertPrivateToPublic <amount>             -- converts the specified amount of private funds to public funds.
```
- Configures the wallet and registers the users with privacy application.

```sh
 > config

#### limitation workflow
To workaround for lack of restart capability, perform the following work flow in event you terminate a wallet.

- You could leverage the restarted instances or optionally uninstall (helm uninstall) and redeploy the privacy application using helm. 
- Re-deploy (admin deploy) another privacy application instances
- Retry the privacy workflows described above.
